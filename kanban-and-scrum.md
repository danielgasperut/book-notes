Kanban and Scrum

Forward

* Kanban is based on a very simple idea. Work In Progress (WIP) should be limited
* something new should be started only when an existing piece of work is delivered
* Kanban seems like such a small change and yet it changes everything about a business.
* Kanban simply
    * Understand your current process by mapping the value stream
    * Agree to WIP limits for each stage in that process.
    * Start to flow work through the system by pulling it when kanban signals are generated.
* Because WIP is limited, anything that becomes a block clogs up the system and grinds it to a halt
* Halting the system has the effect of focusing the team on the blocker
* Kanban provides team members and external stakeholders with visibility into the effect of their actions (or inactions.)
* Through the nature of the pull system, Kanban also encourages delayed commitment on both prioritization of new work and delivery of existing work.

Scrum in a nutshell

* split teams - small, cross-functional, selforganizing teams.
* split work into a list of small, concrete deliverables
* split time into short fixed-length iterations
* plan the release based on priorities in collaboration w/ the customer
* retro the process and start again
* Small Team Doing a Small Thing in a Small amount of time and iterating

Kanban in a nutshell

* Visualize the workflow (Stages)
    * Each work item on a card
    * Columns on a board to illiustrate stage
* Limit Work In Progress (WIP) with explicit limits at each stage
* Measure Lead time (avg time to complete one item)

Kanban vs Scrum

* Scrum more prescriptive
* In order of rules Waterfall → XP → Scrum → Kanban → do whatever!
* Kanban leaves almost everything open. The only constraints are Visualize Your Workflow and Limit Your WIP
* Don't limit yourself, mix and match! (Many Kanban teams use daily standup meetings)

Scrum Provides Roles

* Product Owners, Teams, Scrum Master, etc
* Kanban doesn't require, but could!

Scrum Boxes Time

* Scrum Timeboxes - Choose a length to buuld a cadence
    * Beginning - Plan and Groom an iteration
    * During - Sprint to complete items
    * End - Review and Retrospective, potentially shippable code
* Kanban
    * timeboxed iterations are not prescribed. You can choose when to do planning, process improvement, and release.
    * You can choose to do these activities on a regular basis or on demand

Example, Release Driven:

“We trigger a planning meeting whenever we start running out of stuff to

do. We trigger a release whenever there is a set of Minimum Marketable

Features (MMFs) ready for release. We trigger a spontaneous quality

circle whenever we bump into the same problem the second time. We also

do a more in-depth retrospective every fourth week.”



Kanban Limits Work

* In both cases you're tracking progress of items
* The difference in Kanban you limit wip to an ageed upon number for any stage (ie, 2 In Progress)
* So both Scrum and Kanban limit WIP, but in different ways. Scrum teams usually measure a WIP limit for the sprint as velocity.
* Scrum WIP is limited per unit of time.
* Kanban WIP is limited per workflow state.
