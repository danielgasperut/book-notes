### Build Radically Candid Relationships

  * Listening is your job, Emotional Labor is the key to being a good bosses
  * Bosses Guide a team to achieve results
  * Responsibilities of a boss:
    * Guidance, Giving useful Feedback
    * Team Building
    * Results
  * Relationships not power drive you forward
  * First central difficulty, establishing trust with your direct reports
  * These relationships determine if you can fulfil the responsibilities of a manager
    * create a culture of Guidance
    * understand what motivates everyone to avoid burnout and boredom
    * drive results collaboratively
  * Developing trust
    * give a damn
    * care about each of the people who work for you as a human
    * telling people when their work isn't good enough - and when it is.
    * Challenging people generally pisses them off
    * When people trust you and believe you care about them they are more likely to take your criticism, act on it, tell you what they are really thinking, engage in this same behavior with one another, embrace their team role and focus on getting Results
    * RADICAL is chosen because our instinct is to avoid this conflict and embarrassment. But that kind of avoidance is disastrous to a manager.
    * Bring your whole self to work
    * There are few more damaging things than a sense of superiority
    * Caring personally is about sharing what makes us want to get out of bed in the morning
    * If you can be a good boss it's more likely they will be a good boss
