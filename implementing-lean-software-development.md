From Concept to Cash

Production History
* 1980s Manufacturing trends
* Interchangeable Parts (1780s)
* Intergangeable People (1900s) Henry Ford
* Toyoda Production System (1980)
  * Just in Time Flow
  * Autonomation / Stop the line
  * Non Stock Production
  * Zero Instpection

Just In Time Trends
* Stop the line saftey consciousness - Managing the Unexpected by Weick and sutcliffe
  * Preoccupation w/ Failure - Think about it!
  * Reluctance to Simplify - our problem is complex so our system is also complex
  * Sensitivity to Operations - Every manager should spend time working the line
  * Commitment to Learn from Mistakes - Even the smallest incident should be investigated to prevent it from happening
  * Deference to Experts - every manager knows the people doing the work are the most informed about how the plant works

Lean Family Tree:
* Lean
  * Toyota Production System
      * Manufacturing
      * Operations
  * Toyota Development System
      * Product Development
      * Software Development
  * Suppliers
      * Supplychain
    
Toyota + Suppliers
* When lean reaches the plant walls they have to be extended to suppliers
* Toyota and Dell both treat suppliers as in house, extending them enough information to be involved in the production.

Lean Product Development 
* The approch toyota developed for PRODUCT development
* Generating and preserving knoledge is the hallmark of the toyota product development system
* Elements of the Toyota Product development system
  * System Design by an Entrepreneural Leader - Chief engineer owns responsibility for the product, but also responsible for developing a deep understanding of the target market
  * Expert Engineering Workforce - Managers are teachers who have become masters in the area they surpervice, they train new engineers and move them from apprentice
  * Responsibility based planning and control - chief engineer sets deployment schedule. Engineers know what is expected at next syncronization point and deliver the results without being tracked. if engineers need information to do their job they are expected to pull it.

  * Set based Concurrent Engineering - multipule designe spaces converging on an optimal solution. making descisions only when they must be made.
