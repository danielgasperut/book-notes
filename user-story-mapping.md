Forward

* The Real Goal of User Stories is shared understanding, TALK
* Document to help remember, photo graph, shoot short videos of your conversations
* Build Less - There is always more to build than we have time for
* Outcomes not Output
* Stories aren't a written form of requirements, they're there to facilitate the discussion about the story and solving problems for the customer.
* The names you give to things matter
* Story Maps are for breaking down big stories as you tell them
